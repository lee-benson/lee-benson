I am a software engineer with a growth mindset and an inquisitive nature. I think, generally, as people get older we tend to become
comfortable with our understanding and complacent with our ignorance; it's an easy pit to fall in that limits our growth and subdues 
our curiosity. My journey as a software engineer, a position of lifelong learning and autodidacticism, ensures continued exploration of
ideas, reinforces the asking of "How" things work, and provides inexhaustible opportunities to frustrate over errors.
