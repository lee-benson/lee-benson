I am a software engineer with a growth mindset and an inquisitive nature. I think, generally, as people get older we tend to become comfortable with our understanding and complacent with our ignorance; it's an easy pit to fall in that limits our growth and subdues our curiosity. My journey as a software engineer, a position of lifelong learning and autodidacticism, counteracts that complacency by promoting the "Hows" of processes, encouraging the exploration of new ideas, and providing opportunities to grow from mistakes.
